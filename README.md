What will be included in your app’s description, and what kind of icon will best represent your app once it is made available in the app store?

The app’s description will highlight its primary features, including logging weight entries, tracking progress over time through dynamic charts, and setting personal goals with notifications when those goals are met. It will emphasize ease of use, motivation, and user empowerment, appealing to anyone looking to maintain or improve their health. For example, the description could read: “Track your progress, set achievable goals, and celebrate your successes! The Weight Tracker app makes it simple to monitor your weight over time and stay motivated.” 
The app icon will be clean and visually recognizable, featuring elements that suggest health and progress, such as a stylized scale, an upward or downward trending graph, or a minimalist human figure. Colors from the app theme will be incorporated to maintain brand consistency and make the icon stand out in the app store. Perhaps something that looks like this: 
 


Which versions of Android will your app run on? Have you included the most current version? 

The app will run on devices with Android 24 / API 34, the most current stable version of Android, which allows the app to take advantage of the latest platform features, such as improved notifications, security updates, and performance optimizations. 

What permissions will your app ask for? Be sure to only request permissions that are necessary for your app to run. For example, does your manifest ask for permission to record phone audio when your app does not use it?

The app will only request the permissions that are strictly necessary for its core functionality. Currently, the app requires the “SEND_SMS” permission to notify users when they reach their weight goals via text message. No unnecessary permissions, such as microphone, camera, or location access, are requested, which ensures the app respects user privacy and meets app store requirements. 

What is your plan to make money from the app? Consider whether your app will include ads and require a one-time payment or neither.

The app will be completely free to use, with no ads and no one-time payment required. The goal is to provide full functionality to all users without introducing barriers or interruptions. By keeping the app free and ad-free, it focuses entirely on user experience and accessibility, encouraging consistent use and trust. This approach prioritizes helping users track their weight and achieve their goals without any monetization distractions. Everyone should be able to track their weight if they want to in an easy way: you shouldn’t have to pay for such a service if you’re willing to put in the work to even use it.
